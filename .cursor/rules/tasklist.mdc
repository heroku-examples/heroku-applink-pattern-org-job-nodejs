# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress

## Task List Creation
1. Create task lists in a markdown file (under `docs/tasks`):
  - Use `TASKS.md` or a descriptive name relevant to the feature (e.g. `ASSISTANT_CHAT.md`)
  - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented
  
2. Structuire the file with these sections:
  ```markdown
  # Feature Name Implementation
  
  Brief description of the feauture and its purpose.
  
  ## Completed Tasks
  - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
  - [x] Task 2 that has been completed
  
  ## In Progress Tasks
  - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
  - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon
  
  ## Future Tasks
  - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
  - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation
  
  ## Implementation Plan
  
  Detailed description of how the feature will be implemented.
  
  ## Relevant files
  
  - path/to/file1.ts - Description of purpose
  - path/to/file2.ts - Description of purpose
  ```
